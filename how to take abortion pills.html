A huge benefit of abortion pills is that you can complete the abortion privately—and with telehealth providers like Hey Jane, without leaving your home at all.</p><p>‍</p><p>Having a medication abortion involves taking two FDA-approved medicines over a couple of days. Mifepristone, the first of the two abortion pills, will stop the pregnancy from growing by blocking the hormone progesterone. Misoprostol, the second type of pill taken, causes the uterine cramping and bleeding to pass the pregnancy and empty the uterus.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>Below are the steps to take the abortion pills:</p><p>‍</p><div id="step-1-swallow-1-mifepristone-pill-with-water" style="scroll-margin-top: 8rem;"><h2>Step 1: Swallow 1 Mifepristone pill with water</h2><p>Swallow one  mifepristone (200 mg) pill with water.</p><p>‍</p><p>Most people feel fine after taking this pill. You can continue all of your regular activities. You may have some vaginal bleeding but may not — either is okay.</p><p>‍</p><p>It’s unlikely, but if you throw up within the first 30 minutes after taking it, please contact your provider. <strong>If you throw up after 30 minutes, you don’t need to contact us because the medicine has been absorbed.</strong></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you’re been feeling nauseous with the pregnancy, you can take one ondansetron (anti-nausea) pill under your tongue and let it dissolve before starting Step 1. This medication is provided in your shipment from Hey Jane.</p><p>‍</p></div><div id="step-2-prep-decide-how-you-want-to-take-the-misoprostol-pills" style="scroll-margin-top: 8rem;"><h2>Step 2 prep: Decide how you want to take the misoprostol pills</h2><p>You can take the second type of pill, misoprostol, several different ways: vaginally, buccally (between your cheeks and gums), and sublingually (under your tongue). All methods of taking misoprostol are equally effective, but can cause <strong>more nausea when taken sublingually</strong> (under the tongue) and the <strong>least nausea when taken vaginally</strong>.</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="./assets/666bc697bb9f68f80acb74f8_6583815b7fff53aeaf8847cc_HJ_Illustration_Miso_Vaginal2.png" alt="Illustration showing step-by-step instructions for vaginal administration of misoprostol for abortion" loading="lazy"></div></figure><p>‍</p></div><div id="how-to-take-misoprostol-vaginally" style="scroll-margin-top: 8rem;"><h2>How to take misoprostol vaginally</h2><p>This method causes the least nausea because while pretty flavorless, the pills are very chalky and can be difficult to keep in your mouth for 20+ minutes if they are already feeling queasy during the pregnancy. However, this route might not be the best option if you have started bleeding as the vagina does not absorb it as well in the presence of blood.</p><p>‍</p><p>If taking misoprostol vaginally, you can start Step 2 anywhere from 6 to 48 hours after Step 1.	</p><p>	</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="./assets/666bc697bb9f68f80acb74e5_658382000a684cf24524cfaf_Group%20160.png" alt="Illustration showing step-by-step instructions for buccal administration of misoprostol for abortion" loading="lazy"></div></figure><p>‍</p></div><div id="how-to-take-misoprostol-buccally-between-your-cheeks-and-gums" style="scroll-margin-top: 8rem;"><h2>How to take misoprostol buccally (between your cheeks and gums)</h2><p>This method causes more nausea than the vaginal method, but less than the sublingual method.

This route can therefore cause more side effects. If taking misoprostol sublingually, you can start Step 2 anywhere from 24 to 48 hours after Step 1. </p><p>‍</p><p>Choose a time to start Step 2 when you’ve had a good meal and plenty of rest, as bleeding and cramping usually start a few hours after Step 2. 30 minutes before taking your misoprostol pills, take 800 mg of ibuprofen (pain medicine) by swallowing with water and one ondansetron pill (anti-nausea medicine) under your tongue. The ondansetron dissolves in your mouth and does not need to be swallowed. These medicines will help decrease some of the GI side effects, like nausea, that are common with misoprostol, as well as help decrease cramping.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>You must complete Step 2 even if you have started bleeding.</p></div></div><div class="native-ad_wrapper"><div class="native-ad_text-container"><div class="auxilliary-title">Get started in minutes vs. waiting for an in-person appointment</div></div></div><div fs-toc-offsettop="8rem" fs-toc-element="contents-2" class="blog-post w-richtext"><p>‍</p><div id="step-2-take-4-misoprostol-pills" style="scroll-margin-top: 8rem;"><h2>Step 2: Take 4 Misoprostol Pills</h2><p>Place 4 (four) misoprostol pills (800 mg) inside your vagina OR between your cheeks and gums for 30 minutes.

               Heavy bleeding and strong cramps usually start about 4-6 hours after taking the second medicine, misoprostol, but can take up to 24 hours. Use heavy flow menstrual pads to manage bleeding, which should get lighter after a few hours.

               Intense cramping happens as your uterus sheds its lining and expels the pregnancy. It usually starts a few hours after taking misoprostol and gets better after a few hours. You can take ibuprofen or tylenol or use heating pads to soothe your discomfort.

                Breast tenderness tends to hang around the longest and can take up to 2-3 weeks to resolve, but you should start to notice an improvement within 1-2 days after treatment. You may leak a milky discharge—wear a snug-fitting bra if you do. This should stop in a couple of days.

                You may feel relieved when the abortion is over. You may also feel sad or moody, which is normal and can come from hormonal changes when you’re no longer pregnant.

Whether this process was a big deal for you or just another day, take some time to listen to your body, and do something nice for yourself. &nbsp; It's safe to go back to your regular activities - school, work, driving, exercise - as soon as you feel up to it. You can have sex whenever you are ready (more about sex after an abortion here), and can use tampons or menstrual cups once your bleeding has lightened up.</p></div></div><div class="native-ad_wrapper"><div class="native-ad_text-container"><div class="auxilliary-title">Meet Lola Women's Health Clinic: modern, virtual abortion care</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
